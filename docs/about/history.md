# History

The story behind the development of this project.

## Story

Earlier on, I had released [viteshell v0.6.0](https://github.com/henryhale/viteshell).
It is a minimal bash-like shell implementation written in TypeScript. 
During it's development, I learnt how to build a small custom parser for parsing user input into an abstract syntax tree
that eventually made the implementation possible.

On the morning of *30th December 2023*, I was browsing the internet when I landed on an awesome [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VB5TY1sIRo)
describing how to create a programming language from scratch using TypeScript.
Watching this youtube video inspired me into thinking, *"What if I created an simple custom scripting language that would solve Mathematics problems?"*

My initial idea of this language was that plain and simple. On *4th January 2024*, I made the first working version from which I continued to fix several logical bugs as well as adding several features like builtin functions. 

*5th January 2024* was launch day :tada:
