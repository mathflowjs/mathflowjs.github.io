# Syntax

This section shows you the MathFlow syntax to enable you write scripts.

## Comments

In MathFlow, comments are statements on a new line starting with a _hash symbol_, `#`. These are _ignored_ during evaluation.

```sh
# this is comment 1
# this is comment 2
# this is comment 3
```

## Spaces

Indents, spaces, tabs or empty lines are _ignored_ in MathFlow.
This implies that they carry no special meaning.
