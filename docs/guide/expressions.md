# Expressions

Expressions are parts of a statement that may contain a composition of binary operators, brackets and numbers: _floats and integers_.

## Operators

MathFlow currently supports the following operators;

- Unary Operators: `+` , `-`
- Binary Operators: `+` , `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`

Computations follow the arithmetic precedence of each operator.

```sh
1 + 2 * 3
```

The above expression evaluates to `7` but not `9`.

## Return Values

The result of the last expression in the script is considered to be the _return value_.

The script below results into `5` as the resultant value.

```sh
1.2 + 1.8
2 + 3
```

## Terms

MathFlow enables you to write normal mathematical terms.

```sh
x = 3
y = (2x - 1) / (3x + 1)
```

However, the following is not allowed;

```sh
x = 3
y = 2
z = xy
```

To handle that kind of composition, add a binary operator between the variables. Otherwise, it is considered as an _identifier_ or a reserved keyword.

```sh
x = 3
y = 2
z = x * y
```
